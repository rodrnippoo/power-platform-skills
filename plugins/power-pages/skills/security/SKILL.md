# Security

Coordinate a security review of a Power Pages site. This skill does no scanning of its own — every finding comes from one of the specialized security-area skills or existing plugin skills, and every remediation delegates back to the skill that owns the concern. The value here is the *framework-driven sequencing*, the *unified report*, and the *per-change approval loop* that makes hardening safe.

Every change is one delegated invocation behind explicit user approval — no batch application, no silent writes. The skill that owns the change stays authoritative; this skill never reimplements anything they do.

## When to load which reference

- `references/orchestration.md` — load at the start of Phase 2 (framework selection) for the OWASP category → security area mapping, the full finding-type → delegation table, and the JSON schema the HTML report consumes.

## Gotchas

- **Framework-driven, not tool-driven.** OWASP is a framework. `security-scan` (ZAP-based dynamic scan) is a tool that covers *a subset* of OWASP. Running ZAP alone is not an OWASP review. Known ZAP gaps include design-time intent (table-permission misuse) and network-level checks — cover those via `/audit-permissions` and the posture snapshot.
- **Delegate table-permission audits; do not reimplement them.** `/audit-permissions` already produces an HTML report at `docs/permissions-audit.html` with severity-grouped findings and delegates fixes to the `table-permissions-architect` agent. This skill INCLUDES those findings in the unified report and keeps a link back to the existing `permissions-audit.html` for deep-dive evidence. Do NOT parse permission YAML or re-query Dataverse from here.
- **Auth / role remediations go through their own skills.** When the review surfaces an auth issue, the fix invokes `/setup-auth`. Role-based access fixes invoke `/create-webroles`. These skills have their own approval flows — do not bypass them with direct Dataverse writes.
- **Long-running security checks do NOT block.** `/security-scan --deep` and `/code-analysis` SAST scans run in the background. Kick them off in Phase 3 as soon as the user has picked them in Phase 2, and let them run while the rest of the review proceeds. The HTML report shows partial results immediately; deeper findings append when the scans complete.
- **Skip-all must be explicit and documented.** If the user unchecks every long-running scan in Phase 2, surface the concrete trade-off (the review will miss dynamic vulnerability findings, SAST dataflow findings, dependency CVEs, and IaC misconfigurations depending on which were unchecked — see Phase 2 for the exact disclosure text). Accept the skip if the user confirms, and note it in the report's "Framework used" header so the gap is visible to later readers.
- **Cross-cloud runtime sources.** When proposing CSP remediations in Phase 6, remember `/security-headers` needs the cloud-specific `content.powerapps.*` host — never propose a remediation that lists all four clouds' hosts together. Delegate to `/security-headers` which handles this.
- **Per-change approval is mandatory.** Phase 6 pauses with `AskUserQuestion` before every remediation. The user can accept, skip, or defer each finding individually — never batch-approve.

## Workflow

At the start of Phase 1, create one task per phase with `TaskCreate`. Mark `in_progress` when you enter a phase, `completed` the moment it ends. The final response carries a progress tracking table (see the end of this file) so the user can see at-a-glance what each phase produced.

### Phase 1 — Prerequisites and portal id resolution

1. Confirm the working directory is a Power Pages code site — `.powerpages-site/website.yml` must exist. If missing, tell the user to run `/deploy-site` first and stop.
2. Read the `id` field from `.powerpages-site/website.yml` — this is the website record id.
3. Resolve the portal id once, and keep it for every security-area read in Phase 3 onward:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/website.js" --websiteRecordId <id-from-step-2>
   ```
   The `id` field on the returned record is the portal id.
4. Failure modes (consistent with the other skills):
   - Non-zero exit with a prerequisite message → surface verbatim, stop. Do not install or re-authenticate on the user's behalf.
   - Exit 0 with `null` → site not deployed OR PAC profile pointed at the wrong environment. Ask which applies before recovering.

### Phase 2 — Select the framework and scans to include

Ask two questions sequentially with `AskUserQuestion`. Use plain, user-friendly labels — avoid internal terms like "sub-skill", phase numbers, or internal categorization vocabulary in option text.

**Question 1 — Which security framework should this review assess against?** Single-select. The framework drives both which scan tools are relevant AND how findings are organized in the final report, so findings group themselves automatically by the framework's own categories (A01–A10 for OWASP Top 10, CWE-NNN for CWE, etc.). Do NOT ask the user separately how to lay out the report — the framework answer covers both.

| Framework | What it covers |
|---|---|
| OWASP Top 10 | General posture review combining dynamic (runtime) and static (source) findings tagged A01–A10. Familiar framing for compliance conversations. |
| CWE / CWE Top 25 | Source-code and runtime findings tagged with CWE IDs; the Top 25 flags the most critical classes. |
| OWASP ASVS | Findings tagged against OWASP Application Security Verification Standard control sections. |
| CVE / dependency vulnerabilities (SCA) | Third-party dependency vulnerabilities tagged by CVE and severity. |
| IaC misconfiguration | Infrastructure-as-code misconfigurations (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Helm, Dockerfile). |
| Bring-your-own checklist | User-supplied checklist (markdown / text / YAML) or tool config (Semgrep rules, CodeQL query pack). |

If the user asks "which should I pick", OWASP Top 10 is the most common for general posture reviews — but do not pre-select it.

**Question 2 — Which long-running scans should the review include?** Multi-select. Long-running scans take minutes to hours; they run in the background while the rest of the review proceeds, and results fold into the report when they complete.

Look up the applicable tools for the framework the user chose in `references/orchestration.md` → "Framework → scan tools". Present every applicable tool for that framework — do NOT hide tools the user might want. Pre-check the recommended ones (marked "recommended" in the reference table); the user can uncheck any they do not want.

Label the skip-all path **"Bypass long-running scans (not recommended)"** in the `AskUserQuestion` UI — the phrase "not recommended" MUST appear so the user sees the posture trade-off before they commit. If the user picks it, confirm explicitly before proceeding. Spell out what the review WILL still perform and what it will MISS, using the current framework's context:

> **Bypassing long-running scans is not recommended.** With no long-running scans, the review will still perform these fast checks from the posture snapshot:
> - Site visibility (Public / Private)
> - Web Application Firewall status + custom rule audit
> - HTTP security-header configuration (CSP, CORS, SameSite, X-Frame-Options) via `security-headers --audit`
> - Table permissions (via `/audit-permissions`)
> - Project language detection
>
> You will NOT get:
> - Dynamic vulnerability findings (injection, SSRF, TLS misconfig, confirmed exploits) — these require the ZAP deep dynamic scan
> - Static-code dataflow findings (CWE-79 XSS, CWE-89 SQL injection, CWE-78 command injection, and similar classes) — these require a SAST scan (Semgrep or CodeQL)
> - Third-party dependency CVEs — these require Trivy
> - IaC misconfigurations — these require Checkov
>
> Confirm you want to proceed without any long-running scans.

List only the bullets that correspond to unchecked tools — do not dump all four bullets if only two scans were unchecked. If the user picks a framework whose only tooling is long-running (e.g., CVE / SCA, where Trivy IS the review), tell them the review has nothing to report without the scan and ask whether they want to re-select Trivy or change the framework.

Record the framework and the scan set — Phase 3 kicks off the selected scans in the background, Phase 4 organizes findings by the framework's categories, and Phase 5 renders the report using the framework-native layout.

### Phase 3 — Discover current posture

Run the posture snapshot — a bundled script that issues the read commands from every security area in parallel:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/security/scripts/posture-snapshot.js" \
  --portalId <guid> \
  --projectRoot "<project-root>"
```

The output is a single JSON blob with:
- Visibility state + admin-delegation group id (from `website.js`)
- WAF status + current rules (from `waf.js --status` / `--rules`)
- Deep-scan state + latest report summary + score (from `scan.js --ongoing` / `--report` / `--score`)
- HTTP/* site-settings audit (from `security-headers.js --audit`)
- Detected project languages (from `detect-languages.js`)

Also invoke the existing table-permissions flow in parallel:
```
/audit-permissions
```
This produces `docs/permissions-audit.html`. Wait for that skill to complete before Phase 4 — its findings are load-bearing for the unified report.

**Kick off every long-running scan the user picked in Phase 2, in the background, before proceeding to Phase 4.** Do NOT run any scan the user unchecked. The selected scans typically map to:

- ZAP deep dynamic scan → `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/security-scan/scripts/scan.js" --deep --portalId <guid>` (returns immediately; runs server-side)
- Semgrep SAST → `semgrep scan --config <ruleset> --sarif --output <sarif-path> <project-root>` via `Bash run_in_background: true`
- CodeQL SAST → `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/code-analysis/scripts/run-codeql.js" --projectRoot <path> --language javascript-typescript --querySuite <suite> --sarifOut <sarif-path>` via `Bash run_in_background: true`
- Trivy SCA → `trivy fs --scanners vuln --format sarif --output <sarif-path> <project-root>` (usually sub-minute; can run synchronously)
- Checkov IaC → `checkov -d <project-root> --output sarif --output-file-path <sarif-path>` (sub-minute; can run synchronously)

Ruleset / query-suite defaults follow the framework — see `skills/code-analysis/SKILL.md` Phase 4 (ruleset table) for the exact mapping. The scan completion hook at `plugins/power-pages/hooks/hooks.json` will surface results when the long-running scans finish; pick them up and fold into the report during Phase 5 or Phase 7.

### Phase 4 — Audit and analyze

For each signal gathered in Phase 3, classify it as Critical / High / Medium or Passing check per the severity scheme in `references/orchestration.md`. Then organize findings by the framework chosen in Phase 2 — the framework is the organizing principle, not a separate layout decision.

- **OWASP Top 10** — use the category → area mapping in `references/orchestration.md`. Each finding falls into A01–A10 based on the signal's source and nature.
- **CWE / CWE Top 25** — group by the CWE id on the finding. Posture-snapshot signals (WAF disabled, missing CSP, etc.) do not have native CWE ids; place them under the best-fit CWE (e.g., missing CSP → CWE-1021, WAF disabled → CWE-693) and annotate the mapping in the evidence line so the user can see the reasoning.
- **OWASP ASVS** — group by ASVS section (V1 Architecture, V2 Authentication, V3 Session, V4 Access Control, V5 Validation, …). Semgrep ASVS rules tag directly; posture signals need manual section assignment with evidence annotation.
- **CVE / SCA** — group by package name, ordered by highest severity CVE per package. The review has nothing useful to say in this framework without the SCA tool (Trivy) — if the tool was unselected, Phase 2 already warned the user.
- **IaC misconfig** — group by resource type (e.g., Terraform resource, K8s kind, Dockerfile stanza). Same constraint as SCA — if Checkov / Trivy config mode was unselected, there are no findings to report.
- **Bring-your-own checklist** — each checklist item becomes a bucket. Decide which checklist item each signal fulfills or violates; findings land in the matching bucket with their severity and evidence. Items with no matching signal are flagged as manual-review in the report.

Severity assignment and source-area identification apply regardless of framework. The findings JSON schema in `references/orchestration.md` supports framework-specific category IDs — `categories[].id` is `A01` for OWASP, `CWE-79` for CWE, `V2.1` for ASVS, the package name for SCA, the resource type for IaC, or the checklist-item slug for bring-your-own.

If the argument-hint captured a focused scope (e.g., "only CSP and WAF"), drop any signals outside the described scope before organizing. The framework still governs how the in-scope findings are grouped.

### Phase 5 — Present findings in a unified HTML report

Build a findings JSON that matches the schema in `references/orchestration.md`, then render:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/security/scripts/render-report.js" \
  --findings <findings.json> \
  --output docs/security-review.html
```

The report includes, in this order:
- Executive summary (counts by severity + counts by the framework's own category axis — A01–A10 for OWASP, CWE-NNN for CWE, section id for ASVS, package for SCA, resource type for IaC, checklist item for bring-your-own)
- Framework used, timestamp, portal id + site name, and which long-running scans were included vs. skipped
- Per-category finding list, each finding showing: description, evidence (what was checked and what was seen), severity, source area, suggested remediation, and status (open / fixed / deferred).
- **Table-permissions section that INCLUDES the findings from `/audit-permissions`** re-rendered under the unified severity scheme, with a prominent "Full evidence: docs/permissions-audit.html" link back to the original report. Do NOT duplicate the `permissions-audit.html` doc — link to it.
- Pending long-running results banner: if a deep scan or SAST is still running, the report carries a "Additional findings pending from <scan-type>" notice with the polling command.

Open the report in the browser (or tell the user the path) and pause here for review before any remediation.

### Phase 6 — Harden (per-change approval, delegated remediations)

For each open finding the user wants to address, delegate to the skill that owns that concern. Use `AskUserQuestion` per finding — accept / skip / defer. Never batch approvals.

Delegation map (full version in `references/orchestration.md`):

| Finding area | Delegate to | What that skill does |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication / identity provider / anti-forgery token | `/setup-auth` | Configures identity providers, login/logout, token handling |
| Web-role / role-based access | `/create-webroles` | Defines and assigns web roles |
| Table permissions | `/audit-permissions` | Runs `table-permissions-architect` agent for fixes |
| CSP / CORS / SameSite / other HTTP headers | `/security-headers` | Writes `HTTP/<Header>` site-setting YAML |
| WAF enable/disable/rules | `/web-application-firewall` | Admin-layer WAF changes |
| Visibility (Public/Private) | `/site-visibility` | Admin-layer visibility flip |
| Dynamic scan (verification after hardening) | `/security-scan` | Quick sync scan or deep async scan |
| Static-code finding (dependency CVE, SAST) | `/code-analysis` | Framework-driven SAST / SCA / IaC |
| Deploy any Dataverse-bound change | `/deploy-site` | Push the YAML / site-setting changes |

After each successful remediation, update the `status` field in the findings JSON and re-render the HTML report so the "fixed" markers appear. Capture before / after state on anything that touched Dataverse — the report's `remediation` block shows both.

### Phase 7 — Post-hardening close-out

1. If the user applied any remediation, offer to re-run the relevant read command to verify the change stuck (e.g., re-read `--status` after a WAF enable; re-audit site-settings after a header change).
2. For long-running scans that completed during the session, incorporate their findings — re-render the report with the updated JSON so the final artifact is complete.
3. Clean up transient working files at the project root (findings JSON drafts, plan files produced during the review) unless the user wants to keep them. The unified HTML report itself is a deliverable — leave it in place at `docs/security-review.html`.
4. Summarize for the user:
   - Total findings → how many fixed / deferred / skipped.
   - Per-category counts post-hardening.
   - Any bypassed checks (deep scan, SAST) and the command the user can run later to complete them.
