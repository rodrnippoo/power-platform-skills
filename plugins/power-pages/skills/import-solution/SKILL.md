# import-solution

Imports a solution zip into a target Dataverse environment via `ImportSolutionAsync`. Supports optional staged import via `StageSolution` to check for missing dependencies before committing.

## Prerequisites

- PAC CLI installed and authenticated to the **target** environment
- Azure CLI installed and logged in
- Solution zip file exists on disk (produced by `export-solution`)

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Verify Prerequisites

**Create all tasks upfront at the start of this phase.**

Tasks to create:
1. "Verify prerequisites"
2. "Locate solution file"
3. "Configure import"
4. "Stage solution (dependency check)"
5. "Import solution"
6. "Verify import"
7. "Present summary"

> **Note**: If the import fails with an `AttachmentBlocked` error, a Phase 5b remediation flow runs inline — no additional task is needed (it continues within the "Import solution" task).

Steps:
1. Run `pac env who` — extract `environmentUrl` (verify this is the **target** environment)
2. Run `az account get-access-token --resource "{environmentUrl}" --query accessToken -o tsv` — capture token
3. Verify API access: `GET {environmentUrl}/api/data/v9.2/WhoAmI`
4. Present target environment URL and ask user to confirm this is correct before proceeding.

> **Important**: Confirm the target environment with the user — importing to the wrong environment can be disruptive.

If any check fails, stop (reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/dataverse-prerequisites.md`).

### Phase 2 — Locate Solution File

1. If a zip path was provided as an argument, use it directly
2. Otherwise, search for solution zips: `glob('**/*.zip', { ignore: ['**/node_modules/**'] })`
3. For each found zip, verify it contains `solution.xml`:
   - Use `Bash`: `unzip -l "{zipPath}" 2>/dev/null | grep -qi solution.xml`
4. If multiple valid zips found: ask user to choose via `AskUserQuestion`
5. If no valid zip found: stop and explain — run `export-solution` first or provide the zip path

Present the selected zip file details (name, size, path) and confirm with user.

### Phase 3 — Configure Import

Ask user (via `AskUserQuestion`):

> **Key Decision Point**: **Staged vs Direct import**
> - **Staged (Recommended for managed solutions)**: Runs `StageSolution` first to check for missing dependencies. Shows issues before committing the import. Safer — the stage step is fully reversible.
> - **Direct**: Skips staging and imports immediately. Faster but may fail mid-import if dependencies are missing.

Also ask:
- **Overwrite unmanaged customizations?** (default: Yes) — needed when target has customized the same components
- **Publish workflows after import?** (default: Yes)

### Phase 4 — Stage Solution (Conditional)

Only run this phase if the user chose staged import in Phase 3.

Refer to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/solution-api-patterns.md` Section 5a.

1. Base64-encode the zip file:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/encode-solution-file.js" --zipPath "{zipPath}"
   ```
2. `POST {envUrl}/api/data/v9.2/StageSolution` with `CustomizationFile: {base64}`
3. Parse `StageSolutionResults`:
   - Extract `StageSolutionUploadId` (used in Phase 5 instead of re-encoding the file)
   - Check `MissingDependencies` array
4. If `MissingDependencies` is non-empty:
   - List each missing dependency with its type and name
   - Ask user: "These dependencies are missing in the target environment. Proceed anyway (may fail) or cancel to install dependencies first?"
   - If cancel: stop and advise installing missing dependencies
5. If `MissingDependencies` is empty: report "No missing dependencies found. Ready to import."

### Phase 5 — Import Solution

Refer to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/solution-api-patterns.md` Section 5b.

1. Prepare request body (always use `CustomizationFile` — `ImportSolutionAsync` does not accept `StageSolutionUploadId`):
   - Encode the zip: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/encode-solution-file.js" --zipPath "{zipPath}"`
   - Use `{ CustomizationFile: "{base64}", OverwriteUnmanagedCustomizations: {choice}, PublishWorkflows: {choice} }`

2. `POST {envUrl}/api/data/v9.2/ImportSolutionAsync`
3. Extract `AsyncOperationId` and `ImportJobKey` (note: field is `ImportJobKey`, not `ImportJobId`)
4. Report: "Import job started: `{AsyncOperationId}`. Polling for completion..."

Run `scripts/poll-async-operation.js`:
```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/poll-async-operation.js" \
  --asyncJobId "{AsyncOperationId}" \
  --envUrl "{envUrl}" \
  --token "{token}" \
  --intervalMs 8000 \
  --maxAttempts 75
```

Handle poll result:
- `Succeeded`: proceed to Phase 6
- `Failed` with `AttachmentBlocked` / error code `-2147188706`: proceed to **Phase 5b** below
- `Failed` (other): show error message, query import job for component-level errors, stop
- `Timeout`: inform user, advise checking admin center

### Phase 5b — Resolve Attachment Restrictions (conditional)

Only run this phase if Phase 5 poll failed with `AttachmentBlocked` (`-2147188706` or message contains `AttachmentBlocked` or `not a valid type`).

#### 5b.1 Identify Blocked Extensions in the Solution Zip

List all files in the zip and extract unique extensions:
```bash
unzip -l "{zipPath}" | awk '{print $4}' | grep '\.' | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort -u
```

Get the current blocked attachments list from the environment:
```bash
pac env list-settings
```

Find the `blockedattachments` row in the output — it contains a semicolon-separated list (e.g., `ade;adp;js;zip;...`).

Compute the **intersection**: which extensions from the solution zip appear in the blocked list. These are the types that need to be unblocked.

#### 5b.2 Explain the Issue

Tell the user:
> "The solution import failed because the target environment blocks certain file types that are included in this solution. The following file extensions in the solution are currently blocked: **`{comma-separated list}`**. This is an environment-level security setting. To import this solution, these restrictions need to be temporarily relaxed."

#### 5b.3 Ask for Permission

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

| Question | Header | Options |
|---|---|---|
| The solution contains file types (`{list}`) that are blocked by this environment's attachment security settings. Would you like to remove the block for these specific types so the solution can be imported? | Unblock Attachment Types | Yes, unblock `{list}` for this import (Recommended), No, do not change environment settings |

**If "No"**: Stop and tell the user: "The import cannot proceed while these file types are blocked. To unblock manually: Power Platform Admin Center → Environments → {env} → Settings → Product → Features → Blocked Attachments."

**If "Yes"**: Proceed to 5b.4.

#### 5b.4 Update Blocked Attachments

1. Parse the `blockedattachments` value (semicolon-separated)
2. Remove **only** the extensions identified in 5b.1 — preserve all others
3. Update the setting:
   ```bash
   pac env update-settings --name blockedattachments --value "{updated-list-with-types-removed}"
   ```
4. Confirm the update succeeded.

#### 5b.5 Retry Import

Re-encode the zip and retry `ImportSolutionAsync` (repeat Phase 5 steps 1–4 and poll again).

- If `Succeeded`: proceed to Phase 6
- If failed again with a different error: show the new error message and stop — do not retry further

### Phase 6 — Verify Import

1. Query solution to confirm it exists and version matches:
   ```
   GET {envUrl}/api/data/v9.2/solutions?$filter=uniquename eq '{solutionName}'&$select=solutionid,uniquename,version,ismanaged
   ```

2. Query import job for component results (use `ImportJobKey` from the import response):
   ```
   GET {envUrl}/api/data/v9.2/importjobs({ImportJobKey})?$select=solutionname,completedon,progress,data
   ```
   - Parse the `data` XML field for per-component results (look for `result="failure"` entries)
   - Count: imported successfully / warnings / failures

3. Write `.last-import.json` marker to project root:
   ```json
   {
     "importedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
     "solutionName": "<name>",
     "version": "<version>",
     "targetEnvironment": "<envUrl>",
     "asyncOperationId": "<id>",
     "importJobId": "<ImportJobKey value>",
     "componentResults": { "success": N, "warning": N, "failure": N }
   }
   ```

### Phase 7 — Present Summary

Display a summary table:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Solution | `{solutionName}` v`{version}` |
| Target environment | `{envUrl}` |
| Managed | Yes / No |
| Components imported | N success, N warning, N failure |
| Import job | `{importJobId}` |

If Power Pages components were imported (componentType 61 found in solution):
> "Power Pages components were imported. If this is a new environment, run `/power-pages:activate-site` to provision the site."

## Key Decision Points (Wait for User)

1. **Phase 1**: Confirm target environment — import is not easily undoable for managed solutions
2. **Phase 2**: Select zip file if multiple found
3. **Phase 3**: Staged vs direct import; overwrite customizations
4. **Phase 4**: Proceed despite missing dependencies
5. **Phase 5b**: Consent to unblock attachment types — never modify environment settings without explicit approval

## Error Handling

- Component-level import failures: report in summary, do not block overall completion
- If import async operation fails with `AttachmentBlocked` (-2147188706): run Phase 5b remediation flow (identify blocked types, get consent, unblock, retry)
- If import async operation fails with other error: show `friendlyMessage` from async operation record, stop
- Never attempt rollback — report what succeeded and what failed
- Never modify environment settings (`blockedattachments`) without explicit user approval
